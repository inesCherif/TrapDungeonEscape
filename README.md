# Trap Dungeon Escape


Trap Dungeon Escape is a fast-paced 2D platformer built with **Unity** using **C#**.  
It is inspired by classic trap adventure games where the goal seems simple — escape the dungeon alive — but hidden traps, moving spikes, and timed jumps make it a serious challenge.

## About the Developer

This game was created as part of my learning journey with **Unity** and **C#**.  
It began as a small project to practice 2D platformer mechanics and grew into a complete mini-game.
